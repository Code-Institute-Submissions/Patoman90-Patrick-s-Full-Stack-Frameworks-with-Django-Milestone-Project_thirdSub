                        Cyber Sappers have a range of high end hardware solutions that can be added to a network. They are easy to use
                        and easy to install. They provide proactive cyber security barriers to your network security by actively searching and screening
                        all network traffic both incoming and outbound. They use next generation custom software that is updated regularly by their tech team.
                        The range is constantly being updated and we are striving to expand upon small but proven hardware solutions.
                        One of our services includes a customized cyber security software package that our competitors can only sell as a standard package for general network
                        security. Ours meets and exceeds theirs and can be tailored to the needs of the customer.

                    <p class="text-left">
                        We also provide our customers a security audit that involves physical security and cyber security audits and testing.
                        We then point out all the risks from locks and electronic security to cyber security. We also have a small team of penetration
                        testers who you can hire for your business to see if they can infiltrate your companies security and reach your server room where
                        you secure your precious data. After we are fininshed you get a feedback on where you can improve the flaws in your system and how 
                        we managed to defeat them without detection. All data is then secured on request in our database so if you wish to reference it for 3 months
                        otherwise we will have it securely destroyed to protect your data but the choice is up to you.

                    <h5 class="text-left">Cyber attack repair and maintenance</h5>
                    <p class="text-left">
                        We offer customers a follow up service or the service alone where we look at your websites,databases,servers or hardware 
                        and provide a subscription maintence service that you can arrange to be every 3months - once every 2 years. It is like 
                        a health check up but for your cyber security system. We will then point out any outdated or vulnerable elements in the system and 
                        advise you on what needs to be done and provide the solutions as required on a case by case basis. 
                        Please note that even though we strive to provide the best cyber security solution, like all other providers of cyber security
                        there will still be some chance though slim that a cyber attack can happen. But that will also depend highly on your business.
                        <br>
                        In the event that you have suffered a cyber attack we are there to help guide and service your security system and do what we can 
                        to recover and repair the damage done by any attack from a zero day attack to a trojan. We will then do what we can to upgrade your 
                        system and bring it up to modern standards. Again this is done on a case by case basis depending on the clients business needs.
